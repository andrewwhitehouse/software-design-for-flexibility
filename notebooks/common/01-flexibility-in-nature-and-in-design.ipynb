    "One strategy for enhancing flexibility [...] is _generic dispatch_. We will explore this extensively in chapter 3. Generic dispatch is often a useful way to extend the applicability of a procedure by adding additional handlers (methods) based on details of the arguments passed to the procedure. By requiring handlers to respond to disjoint sets of arhumnts, we can avoid breaking an existing programme when a new handler is added. However, unlike the generic dispatch in the typical object-oriented programming context, our generic dispatch doesn't involve ideas like classes, instances, and inheritance. _These weaken the separation of concepts by introducing spurious ontological commitments._"
