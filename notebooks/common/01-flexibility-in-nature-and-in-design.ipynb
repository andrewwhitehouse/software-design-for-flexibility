Generic dispatch is often a useful way to extend the applicability of a procedure by adding additional handlers (methods) based on details of the arguments passed to the procedure. By requiring handlers to respond to disjoint sets of arhumnts, we can avoid breaking an existing programme when a new handler is added. However, unlike the generic dispatch in the typical object-oriented programming context, our generic dispatch doesn't involve ideas like classes, instances, and inheritance. _These weaken the separation of concepts by introducing spurious ontological commitments._"

There are many valuable uses for degeneracy, including error detection, performance management, and intrusion detection. Importantly, degeneracy is also additive: each contributing part is self-contained and can produce a result by itslef. One interesting use of degeneracy is to dynamically select from different implementations of an algorithm depending on context.
